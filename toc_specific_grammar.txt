[Notation]:

A colon (:) following a non-terminal introduces its definition. If a plus (+) preceeds a non-terminal, the new definition adds to the previous definition of the non-terminal. Terminals are enclosed in backticks (`). Alternative definitions are listed on separate lines, except when prefaced by the words "one of". An optional symbol is indicated by the suffix " (opt)".
